<h2>5 in 5 REDO</h2>
<section>
<p>In an effort to improve my productivity levels and focus more on consistently making things rather than making only perfect things, this challenge had me make one thing per day with a few restrictions, which meant to prevent "what do i do?!" feeling and encourage spitting out work.</p>

<p>My restrictions were:</p>
<li>Use acrylic paint</li>
<li>2D</li>
<li>No bigger than 9inchesx12inches</li>
<p>Unintended themes ended up being the color palette - I got excited about my new paints - and subject - when in doubt, go back to plants, as I've always done.</p>

<p><b>"hello seeweed"</b></p> acrylic on recycled/recycled canvas. 
<p>This one is my favorite of the 5in5 set. I hadn't painted in about a year, and doing this one felt like I was getting back into the swing of things.</p>

<h3>DAY 4</h3>

<p><b>"This one is my 2nd fave"</b></p> acrylic on canvas board. 
<p>I window shopped at a stationary store just before doing this one. Maybe I should try watercolors; this fast style jives with me really well.</p>

<p><b>"Why does wheat have to be the grain that some very very sad people suffer from"</b></p> 4x4. acrylic on canvas board. 
<p>This thing is so small. I'm used to working with sizes 16x20 and larger. Weird experience. </p>

<h2>TAKEAWAYS </h2> 
<li>when trying to do something new, in this case, scheduling creative work, know yourself and don't try to experiment too far or else you'll psyche yourself out</li>
<li>small measurements require small brushes</li>
<li>blue and purple are not eyesores like you thought they were 5 years ago</li>
<li>self consciousness is totally useless; have no shame regarding your own style</li>
