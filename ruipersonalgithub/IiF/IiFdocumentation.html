	<h2>Ideas in Form</h2>
	<section>
	<p>Objective: <b>research</b> and create a <b>presentation</b> on a topic over four days with a partner</p>

	<p>Lillian and Rui</p>
	<p>We did a general study on <b>New York City’s marijuana delivery services!</b></p>

	<p>Working with Lillian, I asked what topics she thinks about often.</p>

	<p>There is not a large amount of written knowledge on weed delivery, specifically in NYC, seeing as it is an underground, illegal operation, and relatively new. So this topic was small enough for us to cover in a few days without confusion and Lillian knows very much about it from the consumer side.</p>
	
	<p>I am studying <b>New York City’s marijuana delivery industry</b> 
because I want to find out <b>how successful underground businesses operate</b> in order
to support making <b>informed commentary on black market goods/services in today’s age</b>.</p>
