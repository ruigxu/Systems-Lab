	<h3>What does America really care about?</h3>
		
		<section><p>To start a conversation about the state of our nation's government in the year 2018, we prompted NYC residents and visitors with the question “If I were in power for a day. . .” in NYC’s historically activist Washington Square Park. Being a large poster to write on in the park encouraged strangers to talk anonymously with each other about their political opinions. </p></section>

		<section><p>Designers Julia Updegraff, Keaton Feigeles, and I worked together in researching Washington Square Park’s background. After observing how people use the space, we realized that though the park has had an active organized protesting presence and number of people daily, the average park attendee keeps to themselves while hanging out or walking through. </p></section>

		<section><p>So naturally, a way to incorporate both political and social aspects was to set up a poster with an open ended question. [pic of poster brainstorming] We first handed out markers to use on a small version set on an easel for two hours, resulting in about 200 people viewing and talking about the question, but only 10 written responses. </p>

		<section><p>Recognizing the poster’s size and interpersonal exchange of markers as deterrents, we enlarged the poster and removed ourselves from the scene, which, despite the horrid weather and drastically decreased park attendance, resulted in almost three times the responses in three hours. </p></section>

		<section><p>We came away from both attempts realizing that things meant for public participation must be as simple and as self-explanatory as possible; people love specific direction, but don’t like being told verbally what to do, so we must use signifiers like post it notes as places to write one’s answer, or one big question repeated multiple times, to garner enthusiastic response. Otherwise, the object will take too much effort to understand, and passersby will pass over it.</p></section>
