	<h2>Ideas in Form</h2>
	<section>
	<p>Objective: <b>research</b> and create a <b>presentation</b> on a topic over four days with a partner</p>

	<p>Lillian and Rui</p>
	<p>We did a general study on <b>New York City’s marijuana delivery services!</b></p>

	<p>Working with Lillian, I asked what topics she thinks about often. She wanted to do this study on Weed delivery in NYC.</p>
	<p>There is not a large amount of written knowledge on weed delivery, specifically in NYC, seeing as it is an underground, illegal operation, and relatively new. So this topic was small enough for us to cover in a few days without confusion and Lillian knows very much about it from the consumer side.</p>
	
	<p>I am studying <b>New York City’s marijuana delivery industry</b> 
because I want to find out <b>how successful underground businesses operate</b> in order
to support making <b>informed commentary on black market goods/services in today’s age</b>.</p>

				<h2><p>2D:</p></h2>

		<p>I have painted an insipid picture of the United States of America - more specifically, the American flag, which I have used here to symbolize the corrupt and broken American government. The lack of total coherence in form speak to the government’s lack of cooperation with its people, while the somewhat gory colors equate to the ways that our America is “bleeding” - people all over suffer needlessly, especially in ways that involve unreasonable laws, such as prison sentences for marijuana use/distribution, or for sex work. As both recreational matters prove harmless to the people (in most cases) and in high demand among the public, the American government actively works to harm those involved in providing those services. This fact makes me very angry at our country, hence my ghastly flag here. </p>

		<p>This piece mainly expresses my rage and nausea at the ways in which the American government operates against its people; because of this, it is primarily aimed at other people who reside in this country, or at those who are somewhat up to date with its monthly horrifying happenings. Personally, I would like the viewer to grimace at the piece, specifically at the flag, and in turn, grimace at this regime/administration. 	</p>
			
		
		<h2><p>3D:</p></h2>
		<p>Continuing from the marijuana delivery theme, my thoughts wandered over to women/femmes and safety.</p>

		<p>Lillian reports that she very very rarely gets female delivery runners, and that runners occasionally get robbed because people on the street recognize their company’s label or shipping equipment.</p>

		<p>A marijuana delivery service owned and operated by women, for women seems like it would be useful, considering the dangers of being a woman or feminine person entering a stranger’s home, or inviting a stranger into one’s home.</p>

		<p>Spaces and services specifically for women are not uncommon; in Japan, many musicians hold women and women-and-children only concert dates, as well as men only dates, to make concerts a bit more comfortable (ie minimize groping and sexual harassment) for attendees. Shelters and prisons are commonly separated by gender for safety concerns.</p>

		<p>So while marijuana is now semi-legal in New York City, women are still less likely to report robbery, assault, or sexual assault to the police in case of any of those happen due to legality concerns on part of the weed, societal pressures discouraging women from speaking up when is bad happens to them, and the extreme potential harm that the police may cause.</p>

		<p>I initially thought to make some weed hair clips that female delivery runners could wear in lieu of company uniforms. While the specific clips I had were meant for substantial amounts of hair, they work equally well as bag or shirt clips, since not everyone has hair suitable for the clips or enjoys using hair clips. The clips could alternatively be worn by supporters of that specific company, effectively being the brand’s merchandise.</p>

		<p>Arguably, the leaf symbol’s shape is ambiguous enough that it can pass as some other leaf, not specifically a marijuana leaf. This may help with being inconspicuous. They can be made into normal pins as well.</p>
			
			
			
		<h2><p>INTERACTIVE:</p></h2>
		<p>We borrow the idea of the blacklist primarily from sex workers online; in order to warn fellow sex workers of dangerous clients, they have created lists of identifying information and descriptions of bad experiences with unsavory clients to the best of their abilities. This is a form of solidarity and protection in an industry where reporting assault or rape can get oneself arrested. </p>


		<p>Because marijuana is also not quite legal, fear of legal repercussions such as arrest and deportation highly discourage runners from reporting robbery, assault, or sexual assault. Therefore, an app that allows runners to read about customers’ safety levels and upload their own customer experiences on the go may prove highly useful.</p>

		<p>This app sorts customers by phone number rather than name or address, which could be extremely dangerous and liable to lawsuit. With each phone number, the user is able to see the name of the customer, overall experience serving them, and any other comments that runners feel pertinent to make. Runners are also able to add onto customer feedback, and enter in new entries for new customers.</p>
