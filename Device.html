			<h2>Soft Fighter Friends</h2>
			<p>These self-defeating machines take the form of two small servos that cause each other to jam up, malfunction, and ultimately stop moving. A collaboration with Raelle D'Altilio.</p>

					<p>In the year 2189, children will no longer be satisfied with 2D fighting games; they will want to see true bloodbath, real in-person battles for entertainment’s sake. However, as society progresses and becomes more empathetic to various living forms, society would like to still retain a sense of ethics. So instead of having living beings fight, they will create small robots that aim to “destroy” each other. </p>

					<section><p>The two demonstrated here have been developed by middle school students Yaelle and Yui. They were inspired by the way that male deer fight each other with their antlers to enforce dominance.</p>

					<p>We originally planned to have two servos that would futilely fight each other. Both would have “arms” attached to the little fan shape included in the Arduino kit. One servo would be hard and rigid, while the other would be soft and flexible.</p></section>

					<p>There was difficulty with the laser cutter and 3D printer, so for the hard arm, we tried out these cardboard arms which moved well, but looked a bit janky, and was not strictly rigid. The soft arm was going to be made with acrylic fabric, but was a bit unengaging.</p>

					<section><p>While trying to get string through the tiny screw holes in the servo fan shape, we discovered that string jams the servo’s rotation and prevents it from working. So attaching some string to the servo and then an accompanying hooked arm that would unravel the string on the opposing servo worked well to fulfill the self-destruction prompt.</p>
