			<h3><dt>ARTIST STATEMENT</dt></h3>
			<dd>I chase tranquility – a still and complete fulfillment that comes rarely to me. Oil painting, with its heady smells and vibrant colors, grants me temporary reprieve, while repetitive movement, or “stimming,” acts as a more accessible form of mental rest. Games, as entertainment and as an art form, can benefit from such calmness; my fine arts background grants me the fluidity to incorporate these feelings into art.</dd>
