		<h2>"Instattend™!"</h2>
		
		<h3>A VR/human service that allows users to experience the outside world in real time, without having to leave the house!</h3>
		
		<section><p>“Instattend™” was a speculative design project about how an emergent technology can have disastrous consequences, an unfortunately inevitable part of societal progress. </p></section>

		<section><p><h3>How it works:</h3></p></section>
			<section><p>A trained representative will go out into the real world, equipped with a tablet and a pair of glasses/gopro, and a headset. The glasses will stream live to your device or VR setup, effectively acting as your eyes, while the tablet will act as your face and voice when indicated. You will tell the representative where to go (take 3 steps to your left and go to the end of the hallway) and who to see (visit Helen in accounting, she's in room 207). When indicated, you and Helen may speak through video call - the tablet will switch to a video call of you, and you two will be able to speak in real time.</p></section>
			<p>Vibrations and sensations optional!</p></section>

			<section><p><b>Good for:</b></p>
			<li>People who can't go outside (agoraphobia, disability)</li>
			<li>When you're sick and don't want to infect your coworkers but also can't miss a day of work</li>
			<li>When you want to go somewhere but it's too far/expensive/unrealistic (Grand Canyon, Niagara Falls, Disneyland, concerts)</li>
			<li>Great for people with sensory issues!</li></section>

			<section><h3>Timeline of Instattend™'s demise!</section></h3>
			<li>- <b>2017:</b> Instattend comes on the market for public use</li>
			<li>- <b>2018:</b> some reports here and there of malignant Instattend representatives causing trouble for clients at their events; better/more through vetting process for representatives put in place and their wages raised. </li>
			<li>- <b>2019:</b> client fee rises as a result of specialized representatives. Instattend public reputation fairly under the radar, but pretty good bc new reps do great job, and Instattend employs minorities, specifically harmless-looking ones ie women, queer people, people of color who are queer or women, etc. which is great PR. Reps also get to learn a lot and make connections which is beneficial to them.</li>
			<li>- <b>2020:</b> In June, Florida, a case appears where a client hires Instattend to attend elementary school graduation. Representative is a visibly queer male of color. Client asks for a front row seat to see their child more clearly, representative obliges and attempts to reserve seat early. School police assume Instattend equipment is a form of child trafficking surveillance (?), arrest representative. Discrimination lawsuit occurs plus questions about who is target of discrimination, representative or Instattend? </li>
			<li>- <b>2021:</b> outcome of lawsuit is that the rep wins, but apparently the equipment is suspicious enough that police alarm is reasonable, so Instattend loses, has no legal ground to fight equipment-related charges. </li>
			<li>- <b>2021:</b> Instattend changes policy to office and work service only, no personal visits. Becomes far more specialized service. </li>
			<li>- <b>2022:</b> Instattend experimenting with extremely discreet livestreaming/camera technology</li>
			<li>- <b>2025:</b> iris-cam is invented. people very excited about it. Instattend doing well on the market, is useful and professional service.</li>
			<li>- <b>2027:</b> iris-cam is deployed</li>
			<li>- <b>2028:</b> crazy evil client uses iris-cam footage to steal identities, data, and bank accounts of 153,624,690 people, causing shit ton of issues for people worldwide. Extreme uproar. Very bad situation all around.</li>
			<li>- <b>2028:</b> all reps who took crazy evil client bookings are brutally murdered</li>
			<li>- <b>2028:</b> iris-cam tech stolen/plagiarized from Instattend, starts becoming widely used worldwide urban centers but especially in south korea, japan, germany, not so much on eyeballs, but instead stuck to women's locker rooms and public bathrooms, and places with children :(</li>
			<li>- <b>2028:</b> Instattend tries to do public placating, owners sell company to Viacom bc it is going to die soon</li>
			<li>- <b>2029:</b> owners also found dead, brutally murdered</li>
			<li>- <b>2029:</b> Instattend disbands/closes down permanently</li>
			<li>- <b>2029:</b> iris-cam condemned worldwide due to ethical reasons - mostly voyeurism related; however, despite public outrage, men still use it for above reasons</li>
			<li>- <b>2033:</b> black market for iris-cams slow down, but still thriving; many on dark web</li>
